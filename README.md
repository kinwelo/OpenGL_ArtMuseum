# Modern OpenGL Art Gallery

This is my project for Computer graphics & visualization university course. 
We started with almost no knowledge of OpenGL and 3d graphics and in the end we are pretty satisfied with what we have achieved because final museum looks as we imagined it.

## Some main facts about project:
- Made in Visual Studio 2019.
- Models were loaded with the Assimp library.
- Shaders were written in GLSL language.
